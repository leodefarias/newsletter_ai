                <p>The National Hurricane Center is actively monitoring a potential storm developing west of the Cabo Verde Islands, with a current 50% chance of formation. While conditions are not ideal for rapid development, forecasters are predicting gradual strengthening as the system heads towards the Leeward Islands. Furthermore, over 400,000 residents are still experiencing power outages from the previous Hurricane Milton.</p>
                <p>Understanding storm developments and tracking their paths is crucial for safety and preparedness, especially in the wake of recent hurricanes that have caused significant disruptions.</p>
