While the searches provided some general information about League of Legends and current events, I was unable to locate dedicated articles or guides specifically focused on Irelia's best builds as of October 2024. Therefore, further exploration may be needed on platforms dedicated to League strategies, forums, or videos for up-to-date build information.
